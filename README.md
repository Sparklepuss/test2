# PoseNet Face Tracking Narrative
Simple face recognition app using p5.js and ml5.js to navigate the context of future identity within society.

# Coding Issues:
  * Would like to be able to change text1.jpg in .js to text2.jpg, text3, etc. with click or key press within .js and not html so that it keeps the blendMode effect.
  * Would like to apply a tilt in css to the #faceMask elements according to either track mouseCursor or the nose.x "tiltY", "tiltX" functions in .js.
  * I would also like to be able to fush the #faceMask element past the edge of the screen without the scrollBar appearing.
